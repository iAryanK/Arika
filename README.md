## Journey of creating the project

1. Initial setup: Initialized the next JS app with shadcn UI and enabled theme toggle using next-themes

2. Configure eslint and prettier: For better codebase

3. Create auth system: Used Auth.js to enable authentication system. Structured to codebase using "route groups". Added nextjs-toploader.

5. Update user model: Updated User model in db by adding username field. Fixed UIs.

6. Update google auth: Updated google auth to take email as the default username when the user signs in for the first time. Created alert dialog for logout. Other UI fixes.

7. Create dynamic profile route: For every user, his/her personalized profile route created. Other minor changes.

8. Create user profile: After some bug fixes, protected user profile is created. Code Modal created in db to store data of coding websites of the user. Leetcode api integrated. CreateLeetCodeData backend implemented. Edit profile Modal UI created. OAuth signIn creates unique username using the mailId itself.
